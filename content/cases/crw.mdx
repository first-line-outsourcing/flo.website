## <Highlight>Goal</Highlight> of the project

Our client works in the video production and entertainment industry and noticed how complicated to find the right people to work on set. Harder to set up a work process with them in a legal way. The idea of this project is to match crew and producers in a location nearby the onset place and pay for the work properly.

## What weâ€™ve done

We have built the high scalable service where producers can find right crew to work on set in selected geo location. Use your profile in LinkedIn or IMDB to sign in. Just find a location by geo search, select suitable crew from the list, check availability, send an offer to get the work done. Crew can set a price, location and availability in their profiles. Payment works with Paypal. We created a mobile application for iOS and Android from one codebase and the performance looks like a native application due to Flutter benefits.
