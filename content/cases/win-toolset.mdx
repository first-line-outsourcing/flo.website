## <Highlight>Goal</Highlight> of the project

Three years ago, the client who had a vision of how to simplify the life of media production companies and optimize their processes with the help of automation and cloud infrastructure came to me. I agreed to help him because we were experienced in working with media files and cloud providers.

In particular, such workflows include
- Files transfers
- Generation and applying of metadata
- Face and voice recognition
- Closed captions creation
- Content archiving to specific media storages
- Transcoding and encoding of video files
- Media content analysis
- Data and files migration between systems
- and so on

It takes a lot of time to sell, build and implement a custom workflow for each client. The client had an idea to highlight the most commonly used automated workflows and create a product which allows customers to automatically deploy any available flow to their media asset management systems with one button.

## What we’ve done

The main requirements were
- Customers can deploy automated workflows with a few clicks to the media asset management system
- Predictable billing system
- Service should be easy extendable
- Perfect scalability and security
- Low costs of the infrastructure
- Fast feature release cycle
- Automated testing and deployment processes

We’ve found out all the details of the client's idea, compiled functional requirements, and proposed a modular extensible architecture for Software-as-a-Service based on a cloud provider mode “pay as you go” with AWS.

Stripe and a subscription payment model were chosen for the payment, but taking into account the system resources consumed.

We agreed on the estimation and started developing all the elements of the system. Our team did the whole work cycle: BA, management, development, QA, deployment, documentation, and support.

All the work was carried out in 5 months, the basic system and 14 independent modules were implemented, which use a web interface, a desktop application, server side automation, and files transfer speed acceleration.
