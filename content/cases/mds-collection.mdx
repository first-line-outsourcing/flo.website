## <Highlight>Goal</Highlight> of the project

"Model to Build" (MDS) is an iconic radio program that has been on the air since 1995. MDS is a literary and musical symbiosis, consisting of the best works of prose, predominantly of a fantastic genre, accompanied by a sound range of the best trends in modern electronic music.

During the years MDS collected more than 1500 stories and wanted to share this collection with everybody.
It should be a mobile application specifically for audio listeners who prefer to easily find a store to listen to right now or create a playlist by mood, genre, or author and share this list with friends or social networks.

Users often want to download a playlist to have it offline while traveling without a network.

## What weâ€™ve done

We decided to create a podcast application with Flutter. For this project, we created everything except content. It means UI/UX, more than 10 screens for the mobile application, a few for the landing page, API, database structure, plugged-in donating service by the subscription model, recommendation system, flexible search, and many other features.
