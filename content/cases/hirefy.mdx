## <Highlight>Goal</Highlight> of the project

Recruiting work often has a routine. Find candidates, read resumes, interview them, and so on. This service provides a number of automated workflows to create and share your vacancy, take a survey, analyze and rank your applicants, show and compare the applicants' answers, collaborate with other managers, shortlist or reject candidates, and finally close your vacancy much faster.

You can ask a candidate to add a video response and then compare with another on a candidate response page.

Hirefy has an informative dashboard for a job where a manager can check the status of a candidate, make a note to each response, filter applicants by selected answers, adjust the ranking algorithm, etc.

## What we’ve done

During meetings with the client, we gathered all details of this idea, made the business analysis work, and suggested a solution based on simple, but trustful technologies. As the result, we’ve built the next generation of recruitment software for companies of all shapes and sizes. It uses sophisticated algorithms to accurately evaluate applicants. You can compare candidates by answers, collaborate with colleagues, check analytics, charts, and scores, create questionnaires, and share them on social networks and by email.
